# ðŸ“Š C# OOP Monitoring App

A Monitoring App developed to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills in C# using .NET. The app monitors parameters from sensors for different patients.

## ðŸ›  Project Overview

This project is developed in **Visual Studio 2022** using the **.NET Framework 4.7.2**. The final result is a `.exe` application that simulates sensor data monitoring for multiple patients.

### ðŸŒŸ Features

1. **Sensor Value Simulation and Pumping**  
   Classes for simulating sensor values and pumping data from multiple sensors.

2. **User Interface with Windows Forms**  
   Built with Microsoft Forms template. The `Forms` class is used to assign functions to various widgets in the app.

3. **Local Database Storage**  
   Classes to store sensor data into a local SQLite database and query information for specific patients at any given moment.

4. **TCP Connection Simulation**  
   Simulated a TCP connection using threads to handle multiple client connections.

5. **Setup Executable**  
   Created a setup executable for easy installation and deployment.
